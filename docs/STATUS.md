# Status and open tasks (hand-off between Claude Code sessions)

Update this file whenever something lands or a task is decided. Newest first.
The step-by-step plan is docs/ROADMAP.md (tick its boxes as steps land).

## 2026-11-13 (5): Phase 0 tooling, first automatic sweep

- 0.1 `tools/ccheck.py`: checks the function length too; `--func NAME`; INCLUDE_ASM functions skipped unless `--all`.
- 0.2 `tools/decomp.py NAME [--check] [--write]`: m2c draft with `include/*.h` as context (m2c in /opt/m2c).
- 0.4 `tools/sweep.py [--max-size 0x100] --install`: drafts every pending function, installs the ones that match as
  drafted (function + its `extern` lines), keeps only what leaves the linked build OK.
- Result: **41 / 1739 MAIN functions in C** (39 from the sweep). m2c drafts with no types: they will be cleaned up
  as headers grow (2.1).
- Left from the sweep: `func_8004DBB0` (extern type clash), `func_80083AF8`, `func_80086604`, `func_80092B9C`,
  `func_8009413C` (match alone, change the linked build: check rodata).
- 0.3 `tools/permute.py NAME --src FILE.c [--seconds N]` (decomp-permuter in /opt/permuter): matched
  `f_TestAppleCollectedBit` at once. First header: `include/game.h` (GameState at 0x800BF870, apple bits at +0x544).
- 0.5 deferred to Phase 5 (docs/ROADMAP.md). **42 MAIN functions in C.**
Next: Phase 1 (Psy-Q library names and C).

## 2026-11-13 (4): C in the linked build

- `config/main.yaml`: the text is a `c` subsegment, `src/main/main.c` (generated once by splat, now hand-edited:
  one `INCLUDE_ASM("asm/main/nonmatchings/main", NAME)` per function not yet in C). `include/common.h` holds
  INCLUDE_ASM (maspsx-keep) and the basic types.
- `tools/build.py` compiles `.c` with the game's pipeline (gcc 2.8.1 cc1 `-O2 -G0 -funsigned-char`, maspsx 2.79,
  as -O1); still **29 / 29 OK** with `f_StopVoicePlayback` and `f_SetIdentityMatrix` compiled from C.
- `tools/progress.py`: functions / bytes now in C per program (2 / 1739 in MAIN).

How to decompile a function: replace its INCLUDE_ASM line in `src/main/main.c` by C (declarations at the top of the
file for now), check quickly with `tools/ccheck.py src/main/main.c` (or a scratch file with just the function), then
`python3 tools/build.py main --no-split` must print OK.

Next: headers (`include/` game structs from Tomba2Edit names), split main.c into files when areas of the code are
understood, permuter, the boot exe and small overlays to `c` the same way.

## 2026-11-13 (3): reference switched to USA SCUS-94454

User's decision, because Tomba2Edit / Tomba Club work on USA addresses. `config/*.yaml` = USA (29 / 29 OK),
`config/eu/` = EU (29 / 29 OK, `tools/build.py --version eu`, asm in `asm/eu/`). Load addresses are found per version
by `tools/gen_configs.py`. Names: USA 886, EU 885; fixed a bug of the first import (names parked by Tomba2Edit on one
shared address had been taken: now dropped). Probe C still matches on USA. USA: 7037 functions, 5161 game functions,
2.31 MB (docs/PLAN.md). `tools/disc_fetch.sh` now keeps the USA image (`game/usa.img`) on a fresh download; no tool needs it yet.
Open: the 118 Tomba2Edit `FUN_*` starts that are not starts in our split (docs/TOMBA2EDIT.md).

## 2026-11-13 (2): Tomba2Edit names, compiler found

- Tomba2Edit reviewed (docs/TOMBA2EDIT.md): **899 EU functions named** (later corrected: see above) from its USA symbols and USA->EU maps
  (`tools/import_names.py`, `// t2e` lines); overlay load addresses confirmed; container formats documented.
- **Compiler: Psy-Q 4.4 = gcc 2.8.1 + ASPSX 2.79** (docs/COMPILER.md). First two functions matched in C
  (first in `src/main/ccprobe.c`, now in `src/main/main.c`; checked with `tools/ccheck.py`: compile + word compare, relocated fields masked; it does
  not yet check that the retail function has the same length).

Next:
1. C in the linked build (now on USA): switch `config/main.yaml` to a `c` subsegment layout (per-file `INCLUDE_ASM`, splat
   `asm/nonmatchings`), compile with the 2.8.1 pipeline in `tools/build.py`, keep 29/29 OK.
2. Headers: game-state struct at `D_800BFFC0`, actor struct (from Tomba2Edit's names: `f_SetActorAnimation` writes
   +0x46, +0x79, reads +0x7C), Psy-Q 4.4 headers.
3. Permuter (`tools/permute.py` from T1) for the two near-misses in docs/COMPILER.md.
4. Name the Psy-Q functions (signature hits) where Tomba2Edit has no name.

## 2026-11-13: repo bootstrap, disc survey, all-asm matching build

Done:
- Repo set up from Tombi-Decomp's tools (CLAUDE.md, README, .gitignore, `tools/session_bootstrap.sh`,
  `tools/disc_fetch.sh`, `ci_download.sh`, `disc_unpack.sh`, `isoext.py`, `setup_native.sh`, `setup_psyq.sh`,
  `psyq_cc.sh`).
- The three discs surveyed: docs/DISCS.md. ES and USA are separate builds (98 % / 96 % of EU functions found).
- Psy-Q version: **4.4** (object signatures; 245 objects / 117 KB in MAIN.EXE).
- splat configs for all 29 EU programs (`tools/gen_configs.py`: boot, MAIN, 28 overlays) and `tools/build.py`:
  **29 / 29 rebuild byte-identical** from disassembly.
- Function census (`tools/funcstats.py`): 7051 functions, 858 Psy-Q, 1019 exact dups, **5174 game functions /
  2.31 MB**. Plan: docs/PLAN.md.

Decisions (confirmed by the user 2026-11-13):
- Reference version EU SCES-02147 (changed to USA, see above).
- No decomp.dev report / report CI: progress is measured locally (tools/funcstats.py, later a local progress script).
- Layout (left to Claude): `game/<eu|es|usa>/` = the disc's files (only `game/eu.img` kept), `config/<prog>.yaml` per program,
  `asm/`, `build/` generated. Per-version configs will go to `config/<version>/` as in T1.

Next:
1. (done, see above) compiler identification.
2. Name the Psy-Q functions in `config/symbol_addrs_main.txt` / `_boot.txt` from the signature hits.
3. Find the overlay loader in MAIN.EXE (confirm 0x80109D84 / 0x80106D80 / 0x80188000).
4. Container formats (TOMBA2.IDX/DAT/IMG/SND) for the port; tools/psxemu profile for T2.
